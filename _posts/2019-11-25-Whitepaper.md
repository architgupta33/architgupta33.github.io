The past decade has witnessed an increased awareness regarding unwarranted flow of data within various organizations. But still these
organizations are able to get away legally because of lax regulations, without making amends on ethical front. In this whitepaper, we raise
one such grave ethical issue regarding organizations transferring data that includes personal information without taking consent from concerned individuals. It is a fundamental right to know how information is being put to use as companies are notorious for the way they use data for monetization purposes, while disguising their true intent by claiming to work for the ‘public good’. It is a clear-cut case of deception and we try to debunk this by making use of two case studies and then provide recommendations – first, legally defining the ownership of data to clearly express the corresponding accountability and rights and then, building upon that idea by introducing the concept of treating data as a commodity. By the end of this whitepaper, we hope to make our user aware about the gravity of situation and provide viable solutions to put this grave matter to rest.
