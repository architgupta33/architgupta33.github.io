<p>I am a graduate student at Duke University adept in using and applying data munging & analytical skills to build scalable business solutions. Working in a time-bound environment with a collaborative team, brainstorming over genuinely unique ideas and implementing them with utmost sincerity intrigues me to the core.
I have a deep affinity towards the field of analytical consulting and have proved time and again, my acumen to think differently. In my free time, I love to play Chess and solve Rubik's Cube, which puts my unconventional thought process up to test. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me up an email at archit.gupta@duke.edu to discuss anything of common interest. </p>
